**Mr Robot Writeup**

> ‚úãüèª Hi, In this write-up we are going to pwn the Mr. Robot machine on TryHackMe, it has three flags, but the most important thing is the process we'll go through to gain root access on this machine, from initial access to lateral movement and privilege escalation

# Enumeration and Initial Access

The first step is to scan the machine with nmap

<span style="color:green">$ nmap -sV -sC -T4 10.10.91.113</span>

![status](/media/MrRobot/nmapscan.png)

This machine has a web interface running on port 80
After checking it, there isn‚Äôt anything juicy there so let‚Äôs move on to fuzzing the directories

But before that, the first reflex should be to check the `/robots.txt`

![status](/media/MrRobot/robots.png)

Awesome, we found the first flag and a dictionary that seems to be a wordlist, looks like we‚Äôll be using it later on
Let's get into fuzzng the directories using `gobuster` 

<span style="color:green">$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.91.113/  -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt</span>

Nice there is a WordPress login page

Scanning it with wpscan didn‚Äôt help much. The wordlist we found earlier might be hiding something

Brute forcing the admin user with it didn‚Äôt give any result

Let‚Äôs try using it to fuzz the directories it might reveal something interesting

There‚Äôs a new endpoint: `/license`, let‚Äôs check it out

A page that, at first sight, doesn‚Äôt seem to hide anything., but it‚Äôs way too long for just a simple page

Scrolling down gave me something

A message crypted with base64, let's decypt it and see what it hides

# Lateral mouvement

Now that we have access to WordPress, we need to upload a PHP shell to the page so we can get a reverse shell to the system

Using this repo shell : <span style="color:green">https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php</span>

The way I use to gain a reverse shell into WordPress is by uploading the code to the 404 page in the theme editor 

I find this method really easy, cuz' after uploading the code all I have to do is type anything wrong in the URL and I‚Äôll have the shell

![404](/media/MrRobot/404.png)

![theme edited](/media/MrRobot/theme.png)

![revshell](/media/MrRobot/revshell.png)

our reverse shell is working, now we need to upgrade our shell, to do that we need to run the following command :

<span style="color:green">$ python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"</span>

![upgrade](/media/MrRobot/upgrade.png)

![upgrade](/media/MrRobot/2nd acess.png)

Let's crack it with crackstation and see what we can get

![2nd user](/media/MrRobot/robot2.png)

Now we are the user robot, and this is the second key

# Privilege Escalation

The first reflex is to check for files with the SUID and see if we can either manipulate one of these files or exploit any vulnerabilities associated with them

To list these file : <span style="color:green">$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null </span>

![nmap vuln](/media/MrRobot/nmap2.png)

nmap is there, which is something weird

This time, I‚Äôm using linpeas to reveal some more information

After using it :

![linpeas](/media/MrRobot/linpeas.png)

Searching this on google, I found this in gtfobins :

![gtfobins](/media/MrRobot/gtfobins.png)

We can get a shell using nmap to gain root access, and it‚Äôs really simple
 
Just two commands: 

<span style="color:green">$ nmap --interactive <br> </span>
<span style="color:green">$ nmap !sh </span>

let's test it out 

![root](/media/MrRobot/root.png)

![key3](/media/MrRobot/key3.png)


And we're done, we‚Äôve successfully compromised the machine

See you in another writeup. ‚úåÔ∏è
