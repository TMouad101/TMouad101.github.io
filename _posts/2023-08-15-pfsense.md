## Introduction
A Captive Portal is a powerful tool for controlling network access, and when combined with FreeRADIUS, it offers robust authentication and authorization capabilities. Whether you're setting up a network for your company or for personal use at home, this method provides a reliable solution.

Throughout this report, I'll provide detailed step-by-step instructions accompanied by screenshots, so you can configure the Captive Portal yourself and enhance the security and management of your network, on pfsense using FreeRADIUS.

For this project i'll be using 3 virtual machines 
1. Ubuntu 20.04  as a FreeRADIUS server.
2. Ubuntu 23.04 as a client in the network (for tests)
3. pfsense
