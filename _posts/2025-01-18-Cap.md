# **Cap Writeup**

> ‚úãüèª Hi, In this write-up we are going to pwn one of Hack The Box mahines, which is Cap.

## Enumeration and Initial Access

The first step is to scan the machine with nmap

<span style="color:green">$ nmap -sV -sC -p- -A -T4 10.10.10.245</span>

![status](/media/Cap/nmap.png)

This machine has:

- A FTP running on port 21
- A SSH running on port 22
- A web interface running on port 80


Let‚Äôs move on to fuzzing the directories

Taking a tour of the webpage:

![status](/media/Cap/webpage.png)

The most important part is the "Security Snapshot" tab. It stores all the scans I've done from my machine and provides the results as a PCAP file, a Wireshark file containing all the communication between my machine and the target machine.

We can download the file

I didn‚Äôt find any vulnerability I could exploit

While looking around the webpage, I noticed that after each wave of scans, it stores the results in a different file under paths like data/5, data/6, and so on. I tried accessing data/0, and here‚Äôs what I found

Nice Some results from another IP, I found FTP traffic and following it led me to this:

![license](/media/Cap/creds.png)

Awesooome I found some credentials, I tried them on FTP but they didn‚Äôt work but when I tried them on SSH:

And bam, it‚Äôs workiiing

## Privilege Escalation

Now it‚Äôs time for privilege escalation  

Using the CVE-2021-4034 :

![key3](/media/Cap/root.png)

And bam, we are root now

![key3](/media/Cap/flagroot.png)

And we're done, we‚Äôve successfully compromised the machine

See you in another writeup. ‚úåÔ∏è
